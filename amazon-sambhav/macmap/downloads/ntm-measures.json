(2) Current usage information indicates that the daily dietary intake of glycine by humans may be substantially increasing due to changing use patterns in food technology. Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration no longer regards glycine and its salts as generally recognized as safe for use in human food and all outstanding letters expressing sanction for such use are rescinded. (b) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs concludes that by May 8, 1971, manufacturers: (1) Shall reformulate food products for human use to eliminate added glycine and its salts; or (2) Shall bring such products into",

(2) Current usage information indicates that the daily dietary intake of glycine by humans may be substantially increasing due to changing use patterns in food technology. Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration no longer regards glycine and its salts as generally recognized as safe for use in human food and all outstanding letters expressing sanction for such use are rescinded. (b) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs concludes that by May 8, 1971, manufacturers: (1) Shall reformulate food products for human use to eliminate added glycine and its salts; or (2) Shall bring such products into",
